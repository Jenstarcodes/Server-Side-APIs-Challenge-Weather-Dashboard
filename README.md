# Server-Side-APIs-Challenge-Weather-Dashboard

[Deployed Link](url placeholder)

## Description

The Server-Side API Challenge showed how a Third-Party API can enable a front-end developer to both retrieve and use data from a third party application for the developer's own website. The challenge involved accessing information from Openweather One Call API via an API key. The obtained weather data was then used to build a weather dashboard which featured dynamically updated information for the user regarding both the current and future weather conditions for a selected city.
